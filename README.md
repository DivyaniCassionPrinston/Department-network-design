## Configuration Steps

### Router Configuration
1. **Assign IP Addresses**: Configure IP addresses for each PC, printer, and other devices as per the network diagram.
2. **Access Restrictions**:
   - **Printers**:
     - Printer in the department office can only be accessed by department staff.
     - Printer in the IT Centre printing room is restricted to IT block staff.

### Switch Configuration (Cisco 2960-24TT)
- **IT Block**:
  - **Computer Lab 1**: Use Switch 5, Switch 4, and Switch 1 to support 60 PCs.
  - **Digital Learning and Media Centre**: Use Switches 8 and 15 to manage connections.
- **Department Block**:
  - **Meeting Room & Network Engineering Lab**: Connect via Switch 3.
  - **Computer Lab 1**: Use Switches 12, 18, and 19.

*(Add further configurations as per setup)*

### Wireless Router Configuration
- **Wi-Fi Setup**: Configure Wi-Fi routers to provide network access across IT and Department blocks with restricted access per VLAN.
